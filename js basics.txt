ARRAY METHOD AND STRING METHOD 


FUNCTION AS METHOD IF IT IS AN OBJECT


PROTOTYPICAL NARRATIVE CONSECT
CERATING THE INSTANCE OF THE ARRAY IS CREATING

protytpe inheritance

xor

left shift bitwise 

operator 


truthy and falsy value 

checksum 

any positive apart one or zero is posiotive 

undefined 
null 
double and triple 
== - check the value 
=== - check the value and data type

+"1" infront number 

"11"===+"1"

for 3 type 
for in and for of (iteratble)

set map heap map


set - remove duplicate value 


type convserion interview

map filter reduce 










global execution context 
function hositing 
scope 
function hositing dosent work with the function expression as variable as function
function without any name is called anoymnous function 

function and types 

closure use is to define the private variable 
sorting question 
call by reference 
call by type



map vs  object 

memory allocation is different 
check key is there or not 
value checking 

better version of objects 


internal function calling the function = call back 

promise 

to stop using the call back
help in async program 


study the chain program using .then()

.finally()

when to use resolve , reject , promise ,finally, 

aysnc - make it sequentially 

await in try catch block and the function should be in async function otherwise throw error


fetch 


json placeholder try sync promise async 
///invoking the method based on the variable use call

apply and call - just call and execute 
bind call the function and then execute



this 

this is used define the particular scope
